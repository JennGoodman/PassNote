School project for Android Development. Local wifi chat program.

This program was developed for Android 5.0 during a mobile applications course at UNCG. The code was a group project and was contributed by Jenn Goodman and Jade Dawkins.

Though this application worked when presented at the end of the course, much of the older networking and activity code has been deprecated and is not currently functional under Android SDK Emu or on a device running newer versions of android.
